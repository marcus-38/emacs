;;; Commentary:
;; This is my personal Emacs configuration. The file is tangled from a
;; literate org document where I try to document what each piece is for.
;; If you found my configurations you are free to use as you please, but
;; please read the whole thing before you do. I regulary commit my
;; configuration even though it is not working. Yes, I know, you shouldn't
;; do that but you have been warned.

;; Here be dragons

;; Code:

(setq gc-cons-theshold 64000000)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'(lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold 800000)))
